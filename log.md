# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a backtracking problem and a trees problem.

**Thoughts:** These are 2 topics that I need more practice. I've identified the key in backtracking is to identify when to 'backtrack/unchoose' and in trees it's mostly using it's main property.  I will focus on these this month. Also, this is my first day of the challenge and I've picked an hour left in the day. Hopefully, I will complete it earlier in the day.

### Day 1: June 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on binary tree problem that involves searching for certain elements and then returning something else returning a null.

**Thoughts:** Still need more practice in Trees questions but I guess writing down different scenarios and just returning right thing forms a skeleton of a tree solution.
