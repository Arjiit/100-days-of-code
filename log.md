# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a backtracking problem and a trees problem.
https://github.com/Arjiit/LeetCode-Patterns/blob/master/backtracking/partitionKequalSubset.java
https://github.com/Arjiit/LeetCode-Patterns/blob/master/Trees/lowestCommonAncestor.java


**Thoughts:** These are 2 topics that I need more practice. I've identified the key in backtracking is to identify when to 'backtrack/unchoose' and in trees it's mostly using it's main property.  I will focus on these this month. Also, this is my first day of the challenge and I've picked an hour left in the day. Hopefully, I will complete it earlier in the day.
