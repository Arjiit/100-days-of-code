# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a backtracking problem and a trees problem.

**Thoughts:** These are 2 topics that I need more practice. I will focus on these this month. Also, this is my first day of the challenge and I've picked an hour left in the day. Hopefully, I will complete it earlier in the day.
